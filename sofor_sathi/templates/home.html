            <p class="lead text-secondary">
                "Sofor Sathi" means "Travel Companion." This isn't just a name‚Äîit's our promise. We created this platform to solve a real problem: finding reliable, all-in-one travel information for Bangladesh is too difficult.
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted">
                We were tired of jumping between different blogs, social media groups, and confusing websites just to plan a single trip. We knew there had to be a better, simpler, and more "humanize" way.
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted">
                Our mission is to be the single source of truth for travelers. We combine detailed location guides, practical route information, and an honest review system with powerful planning tools. We are building a platform where you can go from a vague idea to a fully planned trip with confidence, all in one place.

On our platform, you can review two separate things: the **Location** itself (was it beautiful? clean? worth the price?) and the **Route** (was the bus comfortable? was the road safe?). This gives future travelers the complete story.</p>

Use our **"Contribute"** feature to suggest new locations and routes. Our admin team will review your submission, and once approved, your knowledge will become a permanent part of our platform, helping thousands of others.</p>
